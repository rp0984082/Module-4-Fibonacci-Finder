Fibonacci Number Finder
This program calculates the Fibonacci number at a specific position entered by the user. It uses a recursive approach to find the Fibonacci number at the given position.

Features:
Prompts the user to input a non-negative integer for the Fibonacci position.
Displays the Fibonacci number for the specified position.
Handles invalid input and ensures that only valid non-negative integers are accepted.

How It Works:
The program asks the user to input a non-negative integer for the Fibonacci position.
It validates the input to ensure it is a valid integer and non-negative.
If valid, the program calculates the Fibonacci number for the specified position using recursion.
If the input is invalid or negative, the program informs the user.

Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
Prerequisites:
Java 8 or higher is required to run the program.

How to Run:
Download the Main.java file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the file is located.
Compile the program.
Run the program and follow the on-screen prompts.

Sample Output:
Enter a non-negative integer for Fibonacci position: 6
The Fibonacci number in position 6 is 8.

Error Handling:
The program will ask for a valid integer if a non-integer is entered.
The program will request a non-negative integer if a negative number is entered.
